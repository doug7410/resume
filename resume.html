                    <h2>Summary2</h2>				
                        <p> 
                            I build web pages and application from Photoshop or In design comps using HTML, CSS, PHP, mySQL, as well 
                            as other industry tools.  I am always keeping up with industry trends.  I'm always trying to think of ways 
                            to help your company operate more efficiently. My strongest motivation is a challenging project and It's very 
                            important for me to work for a company where I can grow and contribute daily.
